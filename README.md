# Week-3-Challenge-Password-generator

## Description

The motivation behind this Password Generator was to be able to generate passwords that were secure. I built this project so that anyone who comes across this generator can safely generate high security passwords between 8 and 124 characters that can include a mix of character types such as numbers, lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and special characters. By building this project I was able to put new knowledge and skills into practice such as using promts, alerts, storing user input in variables, validating data, array and string methods, using for loops, 
math.floor and math.random. 

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Upon landing on the Password Generator page, click on the Generate Password button and you will be asked a series of prompts. If the length answer given by the user is outside of the parameter supplied, the system will alert the user of such and will prompt the user to type in the number of characters desired for their password. Once a valid number is used for the password length, the application will ask the user a series of confirm prompts to confirm what type of characters the user would like incorporated in the final password. If no character type is chosen, the application will alert user of such and will send user back to the beginning. If a valid number is supplied for the password length and at least one character type is chosen, a random password will be generated with the number of characters and the character types requested by the user.
